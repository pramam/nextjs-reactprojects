description: Creating equal height cards in TailwindCSS using flexbox
---
In [The Monkey Bar Project #19](/themonkeybar), I had a challenge creating fixed height cards that spanned rows:

![UnequalHeightCards](/blog/EqualHeightCards/CocktailCardsUnequalHeight.png)

As you can see, the images across the 2 cards are aligned, but the title and data below it is not aligned, giving the cards unequal heights.

This is what I would like to create:

Even though 'Mango Orange Smoothie' wraps around 2 rows, the rows below it and the 'Details' are aligned.

One shortcut I found was to truncate the lengthier data to make it fit nicely with the other cards, but I wasn't satisfied with this solution:

It took me a lot of searching, experimenting, failing and searching again before I found a solution. There were Stack Overflow posts on using flex-1 but that didn't work when the cards wrapped around multiple rows. I finally found a solution in this [blog post](https://mono.software/2020/07/29/equal-height-cards-with-flexbox/). As of this writing, the blog post has a typo, but their codepen link is correct.

Here's the solution summarized below:

```typescript
<Outer> flex flex-row flex-wrap w-full
  <Inner> flex flex-row w-full sm:w-1/2 md:w-1/3 my-2
    <Card> flex flex-col w-full
      <header/>
      <Long content> flex-grow (only 1 long content)
      <footer/>
    </Card>
  </Inner>
  <Inner> flex flex-row w-full sm:w-1/2 md:w-1/3 my-2
    <Card> flex flex-col w-full
      <header>
      <Long content> flex-grow (only 1 long content)
      <footer>
    </Card>
  </Inner>
  ...
</Outer>
```

The Outer Container div has `flex flex-row flex-wrap w-full`
It iterates over an Inner Container which has the classes `flex flex-row w-1/3` so each card takes up 1/3rd of the width.


```typescript
 {/* Outer:  */}
    <ul className="flex flex-row flex-wrap w-full">
        {cocktails.map((obj, index) => {
            return (
            
             Inner 
                <li key={obj.id} className="flex flex-row w-full sm:w-1/2 md:w-1/3 my-2" >
                    <CocktailCardFlex2 {...obj} />
                </li>
                )
        })}
    </ul>
```

Now, inside each card, use "flex flex-col w-full" and list the image and text.
The image has fixed height.
The lengthier content(there can only be one item which is extra long) has "flex-grow flex-wrap".
"flex-grow" allows that content to grow and aligns that data with the other cards, from what I understand.


```typescript
 CocktailCardFlex2: (Edited for brevity. See the Github link above for the full checkin)
<article className="flex flex-col w-full justify-center items-center mx-5 sm:mx-2 lg:mx-7 shadow-lg rounded-lg">
    <img className="rounded-t-lg sm:w-full sm:object-cover sm:h-64 md:h-64 2xl:h-76"
         src={image} alt={name} />
   
    {/* Long content: h1, has flex-grow */}
    <h1 className="flex-grow flex-wrap text-center mx-2 bg-white font-monkeylogo font-semibold text-monkey-gold text-xl">
        {name}
    </h1>
    <p className="text-center sm:text-left mx-2 bg-white capitalize text-xl whitespace-nowrap ">
        {glass}
    </p>
    <footer> 
        <p className="mt-3 capitalize text-center text-base font-monkeylogo text-monkey-gold font-semibold">Details</p>
    </footer>
</article >
```
