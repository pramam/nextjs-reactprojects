Welcome!

I built this website to create a portfolio of projects with TailwindCSS, Javascript, React, React Hooks and Next.js.

I found the inspiration by learning about React Hooks from [this free course on React Hooks by John Smilga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UZrsTqkcW4), offered by [freecodecamp.org](freecodecamp.org). 

This course comes with [15 accompanying projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7Z7C_JCyo), [source code](https://github.com/john-smilga/react-advanced-2020/tree/3391e14e93678ddd50389ffe989c6e9e560f8db7) and these are the initial projects I am replicating on this website. The full course is offered on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-tutorial-and-projects-course). The Udemy course has these 15 projects plus 8 more advanced projects for a total of 23 projects which I wanted to do, so I bought the course. It is also a good way to support the instructor.

My goal is to replicate these projects without looking at the tutorial or the source code as the best way to learn is by deliberate practice. By struggling through and solving bits I don't immediately get, I learn in a way that sticks. I peek once in a way at the tutorial/source code when I get stuck. 

I have taken the liberty to also look for design inspiration on the web, like with the [Slider Project](/slider), and also tweak the design and color choices of the different projects based on my personal design aesthetics.

The [timeline](/) shows all the projects in progression, along with links to their respective Blog, Demo, Inspiration and (my) Github.

This has been a fun and fabulous exercise. If you'd like to hire me, please reach out to me at [@pallaviramam](https://twitter.com/pallaviramam) on Twitter.
