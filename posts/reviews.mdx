Here's the React Component:

<Reviews/>

## useEffect with a dependency on `current` slide
This slide solution uses useEffect with a dependency on the current slide# to refresh the page when an arrow is clicked. It is a surprisingly easy way to implement this solution. 

```typescript
    const [current, setCurrent] = useState(reviewData.length - 1);

    const clickPrevHandler = () => {
        current === 0 ?
            setCurrent(reviewData.length - 1) : setCurrent(prevCurrent => prevCurrent - 1)
    }

    const clickNextHandler = () => {
        current === reviewData.length - 1 ?
            setCurrent(0) : setCurrent(prevCurrent => prevCurrent + 1)
    }

    useEffect(() => {
        // Every time current changes, re-render
    }, [current])
```

## Implementing a fancy image with an icon
It was fun to implement the "FancyImage"[(source code)](https://github.com/pramam/nextjs-reactprojects/blob/main/components/4-Reviews/FancyImage.tsx) which shows the larger circle at the back and a smaller circle with front with a quote on it. The quote is created by placing a quote icon on the smaller circle.
The implementation uses z-index and translate to implement this. 

## Changing background colors for the images
The inspiration project had only one color in the background for all the images. I decided to make my implementation more colorful by having different color backgrounds for the different images. I put the bg-color in the data.json file. TailwindCSS doesn't play nice with dynamic CSS read from a file. PurgeCSS purges any utility classes
not found in the source code, so this solution didn't initially work for production builds(they worked for dev builds).I hacked it by putting a comment with the text colors in the source code, so PurgeCSS wouldn't strip them out
for production builds.

In general, to solve this, it is best not to put TailwindCSS utility classes in a data file.
