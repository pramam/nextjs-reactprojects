Here's the React Component:
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-r from-gray-300 via-red-100 to-gray-300">
    <Menu />
</div>

Searching for good food photography and designing this menu and text was more fun than the rest of the project. By now I was very comfortable with useState and this was an easy implementation. Can you guess how the menu displays
only Beverages, Breakfast or Lunch?
