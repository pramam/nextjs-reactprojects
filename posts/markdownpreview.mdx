This was a relatively simple project to create two "pages", the input area is a textarea.

To display the Markdown text as HTML the npm package react-markdown is used which wraps the markdown.

``` typescript
<ReactMarkdown>
{markdown}
</ReactMarkdown>
```

The only glitch was that since Tailwind CSS wipes out all html styles, the text wasn't displayed as HTML in the output area.

The solution was to wrap this in Tailwind's Typography class "prose".

```typescript
<div className="prose">
    <ReactMarkdown>
        {markdown}
    </ReactMarkdown>
</div>
```
