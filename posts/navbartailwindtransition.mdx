description: Build a navbar with a dropdown menu on mobiles using Tailwind's Transition react component

The [previous project](/navbarproject) used useRef and vanilla css to pass in the dynamic height of the dropdown. It did not use Tailwind's height classes. I wanted to find a better solution and headed over to their [@headlessui/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@headlessui/react) project which has a React component `<Transition/>` built exactly for this purpose.

Here is what it looks like (scroll down on a large screen):

<div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-r from-gray-100 via-gray-100 to-gray-100">
    <NavbarTailwind />
</div>

If you are viewing this on a mobile, this is what it looks like on a large screen:

This is what it looks like with the menu collapsed on a mobile:

This is what it looks like with the menu expanded on a mobile:

To understand how the `<Transition/>` component works, click on the button below:

<TailwindTransitionExample/>

The code for this can be found on the [npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@headlessui/react#basic-example).

To modify my code, I cleaned up all uses of useRef and useEffect and do not calculate the height of the drop down. Instead I pass the dropdown's CSS to the `<Transition/>` component to handle.

The source code is [here](https://github.com/pramam/nextjs-reactprojects/tree/main/components/14-Navbar/15-NavbarTailwind).
