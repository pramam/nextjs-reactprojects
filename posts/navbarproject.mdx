[This](https://react-projects-11-navbar.netlify.app/) is what I am trying to replicate. 

[This](/navbarproject) is what I created. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/pramam/nextjs-reactprojects/tree/main/components/14-Navbar)

Here is what it looks like (scroll down on a large screen):

<div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-r from-gray-100 via-gray-100 to-gray-100">
    <Navbar />
</div>

If you are viewing this on a mobile, this is what it looks like on a large screen:

This is what it looks like with the menu collapsed on a mobile:

This is what it looks like with the menu expanded on a mobile:

I found this project challenging to make work with TailwindCSS.

To understand why, here's a color and height transition using tailwindcss transitions. Click the green box to see it expand in height:

<TransitionHeightExample/>

Here is how to add transitions to tailwindcss:
tailwind.config.js:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      transitionProperty: {
        'height': 'height', // This is for Project Navbar, TransitionHeightExample
      },
    },
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {
      height: ['responsive', 'hover', 'focus', 'active'] // This is for TransitionHeightExample
    },
  },
}
```

The code is below. Using a state variable, the css applied to the box is changed.
The green box is in `common_props`, `h-8`, the red box is `clicked_props`, `h-24`.

```typescript
import { useState } from 'react'

export default function TransitionHeightExample() {
    const [isclicked, setIsclicked] = useState(false)
    const clickHandler = () => {
        setIsclicked(!isclicked)

    }
    const common_props = "h-8 w-8 my-4 transition-all duration-700 ease-in-out bg-green-500"
    const clicked_props = "h-24 hover:bg-red-500"
    return (
        <div className="flex flex-row justify-center">
            <button type="button" onClick={clickHandler}
                className="focus:outline-none border border-transparent">
                <div className={isclicked ? `${common_props} ${clicked_props}` : common_props}>
                </div>
            </button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

The problem with this solution is that the expanded height `h-24` is hardcoded.
When the drop down menu expands in the navbar, the menu items may be dynamic and so the height will have to be specified dynamically.

The way to do this is to use useRef to get the height of the DOM element and use that in the transition. 
Please watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7Z7C_JCyo&t=16887s) from the freecodecamp course for more information.

TailwindCSS does not play well with dynamic values. If you want to add specific heights not included in default `h-*`, then you need to add it to tailwind.config.js. I landed up using vanilla CSS in the menu dropdown instead of tailwind CSS to implement this transition. See this [github link](https://github.com/pramam/nextjs-reactprojects/tree/main/components/14-Navbar) for details.
