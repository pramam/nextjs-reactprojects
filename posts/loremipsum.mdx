description: Generate paragraphs other than Lorem Ipsum
---
[This](https://react-projects-8-lorem-ipsum-generator.netlify.app/) is what I am trying to replicate. 

[This](/loremipsum) is what I created. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/pramam/nextjs-reactprojects/tree/main/components/11-LoremIpsum)

Here's what it looks like:

<div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-r from-gray-300 via-green-300 to-gray-300">
    <LoremIpsum />
</div>

This is a pretty simple project and the primary goal  is to get comfortable coding a simple form. The sample paragraphs are obtained from [hipsum.co](https://hipsum.co/) and stored in an array of strings, one for each paragraph.
The react hook useState is used to store the data that is displayed.

Here is some code:

```typescript
    // Stores the number of paragraphs to generate
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
    // This stores the database of all available paragraphs
    const [paragraphs, setParagraphs] = useState(loremipsumdata);
    
    // Number of paragraphs to display
    const [display, setDisplay] = useState([]);

    const maxcount = paragraphs.length

    const handleSubmit = (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        // setCount is asynchronous; cannot call it inside if loop.
        let amount = count;
        if (amount <= 0) {
            amount = 1;
            // Cannot call setCount here
        }
        if (amount > maxcount)
            amount = maxcount; // Cannot call setCount here
        console.log(`setting Display: [0, ${amount}]`)
        setDisplay(paragraphs.slice(0, amount))
        setCount(amount)
    }
```

The main lesson learned was that the `setCount` hook call is asynchronous and I cannot call it multiple times inside the if/else condition in the handleSubmit code. The workaround was to store the count in `amount`, manipulate it, and call `setCount` only once in the end.
