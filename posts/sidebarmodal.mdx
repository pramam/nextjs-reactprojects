[This](https://react-projects-12-sidebar-modal.netlify.app/) is what I am trying to replicate. 

[This](/sidebarmodal) is what I created. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/pramam/nextjs-reactprojects/tree/main/components/16-SidebarModal)

Here's what it looks like:
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-r from-green-500 via-gray-400 to-green-500 ">
    <SidebarModal />
</div>

I see a bug above where the Menu is scrolling down to the middle of the component on this page and I am not sure how to fix it.

A few things learned from this project:

- The Menu Button on the left and the Sidebar are in position `fixed`.

- I used TailwindCSS `pointer-events-none` to gray out the Menu and Sidebar when the Modal is open.

- Integrating useContext on a working solution initially seemed cumbersome, but I see the beauty of accessing the context from anywhere.
