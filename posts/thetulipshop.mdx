The original tutorial [INSPIRATION](https://react-projects-14-usereducer-cart.netlify.app/) has a one page website with a simple cart to demonstrate the use of `useReducer` and `useContext` hooks.

I decided to build a site inspired by the design of [The Bohemian Traders](https://bohemiantraders.com) and created [The Tulip Shop](/thetulipshop).

Since [The Tulip Shop](/thetulipshop) has a long landing page,I am not including it here as a react component. Please visit the website to see it functioning to follow this blog post.

I've picked up the following features from the inspiration website, The Bohemian Traders:

- A Hero Image with a text overlay, which is clickable.

- Displaying photos in a collage with the following format:
  
  <--------------Hero Image[0]------------->

  <--Image[1]--><--Image[2]--><--Image[3]-->
  
  <----------------Image[4]---------------->
  
  <------Image[5]-----><------Image[6]----->
  
  <----------------Image[7]---------------->
  
  <----------------Image[8]----------------> 

- A fixed Navbar, so when you scroll down the Navbar is still visible.

- A menu button on the left on md: and smaller screens, which opens a Sidebar.

- Navigation from the Sidebar to the shopping page.

- Navigation to Home page(the Logo) when Sidebar is open.

And I haven't even got started on building the cart as yet!
