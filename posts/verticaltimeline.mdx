To showcase all the react projects, I took inspiration from 2 vertical timeline components: [Tailwind Vertical Timeline](https://tailwindcomponents.com/component/vertical-timeline) and [React Vertical Timeline Component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-vertical-timeline-component).

I copied the code from Tailwind Vertical Timeline and modified it to suit my design tastes. Day numbers were added to showcase the progression of this portfolio.

## Lesson Learned:

I did not make ensure that all my changes were responsive with every checkin. Eventually I realized that it looked good either on mobiles OR on large screens, but not on both. So I had to redo it from scratch to find the bug. It is always better to make sure every change works in a responsive way right from the beginning.
