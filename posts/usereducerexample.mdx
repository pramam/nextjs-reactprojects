[A few projects ago](/posts/grocerylist), I'd mentioned that state management was getting cumbersome and one could potentially have to look into [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai) for state management.

Well, it seems like the creators of React Hooks felt the same pain and introduced useReducer.

Find the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UZrsTqkcW4&t=26992s).

Follow this [blog post](https://www.benmvp.com/blog/type-checking-react-usereducer-typescript/) to make it work for Typescript.

Here's the component created with useReducer:

<UseReducerExample/>

Here's [my source code](https://github.com/pramam/nextjs-reactprojects/tree/main/components/examplecode/UseReducerExample).
