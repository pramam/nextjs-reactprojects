The React component:
<BubbleWrap rows={8} cols={10}/>

This was a simple project, understanding how to use useState to toggle the state of a bubble. The original did not have a "reset".

## Things to consider
Initially I wasn't focused on the responsiveness of an app. A couple of projects on, I came back and made this responsive. Adam Wathan of Tailwindcss recommends that one start with the small mobile screens and adjust the design upwards as you increase the screen size. For about 10 projects now, I've gone in the reverse direction-- coding for lg: screens before tackling the smaller screens.
