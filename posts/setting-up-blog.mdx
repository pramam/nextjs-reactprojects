I found it tricky to set up a blog with mdx in nextjs. I wanted a Table of Contents and I also wanted the ability to display react components in the blog posts.

I found blog posts that referenced using `@next/mdx`, then `next-mdx-enhanced`, but there were [performance problems](https://leerob.io/blog/tailwind), so the latest recommendation was to use [`next-mdx-remote`](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote).

I found a quick hack, thanks to a colleague, by looking at vercel's [example code](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-mdx-remote
). I replicated their code by doing the following:
- `npm install gray-matter`
- `npm install next-mdx-remote`
- Copy `vercel/with-mdx-remote/components` -> `my-repo/components/blog`
- Copy `vercel/with-mdx-remote/utils` -> `my-repo/utils`
- Copy `vercel/with-mdx-remote/posts` -> `my-repo/posts`
- Copy `vercel/with-mdx-remote/pages/posts/[slug].js` -> `my-repo/pages/posts/[slug].js`
- Copy `vercel/with-mdx-remote/pages/index.js` -> `my-repo/pages/blog.js`

My blog posts are in `my-repo/posts`, and the `posts/[slug].js` implementation automatically pulls in those posts and displays them.

Note that the API route `posts/[slug].js` means that you cannot have blog posts in subdirectories of `my-repo/posts`. The .mdx files have to be in the directory `my-repo/posts` for the API route to work.

A vanilla tailwind installation strips out all formatting for mdx files. I wanted to use tailwindcss styling, so I installed `@tailwindcss/typography` by following [these instructions](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography#installation).

In the `components/blog/Layout.js` component, I edited it to be:
```tsx
    <div className="flex justify-center">
        <div className="mx-auto prose"> {children}</div>
    </div>
```
The utility class `prose` automatically formats the MDX content using `@tailwindcss/typography` styles. I think I'd like to change this theme in the future, but it works for now and I have a blog up and running!

To add a React component to your MDX blog post:
- Add the component to `pages/posts/[slug].js`
```typescript
const components = {
    a: CustomLink,
    // It also works with dynamically-imported components, which is especially
    // useful for conditionally loading components for certain routes.
    // See the notes in README.md for more details.
    TestComponent: dynamic(() => import('../../components/blog/TestComponent')),
    Head,
    BubbleWrap: dynamic(() => import('../../components/0-Bubbles/BubbleWrap')),
}
```
- You don't need to import the component in the .mdx file. You can just use it like so:
```typescript
<BubbleWrap rows={2} cols={5}/>
```
Here it is:
<BubbleWrap rows={2} cols={5}/>
