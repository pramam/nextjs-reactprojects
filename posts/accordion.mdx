description: An accordion implemented using React Hooks without CSS calculations
---
Here's the React Component:

<div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-r from-green-400 to-blue-500">
    <Accordion />
</div>

I was advised by a collegue to use flex-box instead of grid to allow the browser to calculate the best fit, so this 
implementation uses flex-box.

## useState only React Hook used
In a previous [Tours project blog](/posts/tours)[(source code)](https://github.com/pramam/nextjs-reactprojects/blob/22f7faa57adc0bdf36f4ae5b8146410111967a8d/components/3-Tours/Tour.tsx#L16) I mentioned that I used useState and useEffect to implement the 'accordion' like functionality for that project. In that project, the `text size` was updated to display additional information 
and hence useEffect was required. Well, I've since learned that
when a useState state variable changes, a re-render automatically happens, so in this project I just had to toggle the state variable to display the accordion functionality and I skipped using useEffect for this project.

This is getting to be real fun and I cannot stop coding! :)
