description: Fetching data from a URL in useEffect
---
I am doing a free course on [React Hooks by John Smilga](https://youtu.be/4UZrsTqkcW4?t=19164), offered by freecodecamp.org and this is one of the exercises on useEffect. 

This URL is used to fetch user data from github: [https://api.github.com/users](https://api.github.com/users)

The API fetches a limited number of users from Github. I decided to extend it and also fetch the number of repos of each user from the data returned by the `users` url. There seems to be an upper bound of 30 on the number of repos returned.

This is my [final project](/githubusers). Source code is [here](https://github.com/pramam/nextjs-reactprojects/commits/main/components/2-Github).

## Challenge
One of the challenges was how to do a fetch call inside a map. I ran into issues and found the solution in this blog post:

[How to use async functions inside a map function](https://advancedweb.hu/how-to-use-async-functions-with-array-map-in-javascript/).

My current solution does not handle concurrency issues. This is a ToDo for the future. Error handling also needs a code review--I get a 403 on some runs.
