description: Implementing a search function via an API

This project uses the [Cocktail DB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) to fetch and display drinks on a webpage.
The drinks are searchable, and when you enter a search term, it calls the API again which returns relevant data.

The design inspiration for the cocktail card is from [here](https://tailwindcomponents.com/component/nowruz1400-square-card), where I  use this as inspiration to display the "Alcohol" tag.

To display the Cocktail cards, I needed to create equal height cards. I've blogged about it [here](/posts/equal-height-cards).

Dynamic API routes in Next.js were used to display each cocktail card when you click on "Details".
